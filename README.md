# odin-recipes

An HTML focused project in which some recipes are linked to check them in more detail

The technologies and skills applied in this project are HTML and its basics.

When completed, I'm going to know that my skills of HTML are enough to start learning basic CSS and then apply it to this and other projects to come.
